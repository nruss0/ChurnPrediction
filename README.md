Telecom Churn Prediction
## A major issue with telecom companies today is the loss of a customers business to a competitor, or "churning".
If accurately predicted and correctly analyzed, a plan to intervene can be implemented. 
### Churn is a major problem for telecom companies due to the fact that it is more expensive to obtain a new customer than is it to keep an existing customer.
This project is about enabling churn reduction using analytics.
